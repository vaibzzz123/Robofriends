# Robofriends

A small app made with React, that shows profile cards of users. Sample data taken from jsonplaceholder API.

To use this, make sure you have node/npm installed on your computer. Then clone the repository, and in the directory, enter `npm install` in the terminal to get the dependencies. Finally, enter `npm start` to start the web server for the app. Default place to access is localhost:3000 on your browser.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
